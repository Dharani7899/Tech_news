    <h2>What are Liquid Trees, and how do they work?</h2> 

<p> This innovative green idea has come from Serbian biophysical scientist <mark>Dr. Ivan Spasojevic</mark> and the project‚Äôs authors from the Institute for Multidisciplinary Research at the University of Belgrade.<br>
     They have developed an incredible new tool called ‚ÄúLiquid tree‚Äù short for ‚ÄúLiquid 3‚Äù to combat air pollution. <br>
     This short form is sweet and suitable because many people misinterpreted this concept because of the word ‚ÄúTree.‚Äù </p>

‚ÄòLiquid 3‚Äô is a photo-bioreactor made using microscopic fibers in plant cell walls called cellulose nanofibers. <br>Scientists have processed these fibers into a liquid form and made out a substance with equivalent properties to natural wood, including high strength and toughness. <br>Tanks are filled with six hundred liters of water and microalgae. These microalgae convert carbon dioxide into pure oxygen through photosynthesis. It is estimated that liquid3 can remove as much carbon as a 10-year-old tree. On the other hand, thriving algae are used to generate energy. Liquid3 has a solar roof that uses dead biomass of algae. 

<h2>Urbanization ‚Äì liquid3 vs. real tree</h2> 

Liquid 3 is a concept created for cities with a limited area of high air pollution with fewer trees. Unfortunately, we saw different misinterpreted tweets shared promoting liquid3 as a replacement for actual trees. Here are some of those tweets.  
Therefore, we looked into the insights of an expert in the field. 

<h2>Naturalist Mr. Aruna Padmapermuma</h2>

Naturalist Mr. Aruna Padmapermuma explains that ‚Äúadult trees (of more than 10yrs) are the most efficient in controlling the amount of carbon dioxide in a city. However, many challenges are faced when placing trees in a city.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOn the other hand, allergies, asthma, and hay fever can spread faster because of city tree pollen. The functions of ‚Äòliquid3‚Äô are similar to that of trees and grass. Yet, it is more efficient than trees because of the ability of microalgae to survive in polluted environments. Trees are more sensitive to polluted environments compared to microalgae. 

Liquid3 is placed in areas where trees cannot be planted, like shopping malls, highways, and busy areas, with limited space. Owners of Liquid3 stated that microalgae are more resistant to heavy metals than trees. Their biomass analysis found that microalgae clean 300 to 3,000 cubic meters of air from heavy metals, which is relatively high. 

However, we want to prioritize the research of floral species, which take CO2 typically higher than other plants like the Sansevieria family, which are easily planted in cities, Mr. Aruna added. 

City trees have so much more value. They add natural character to our cities and towns and provide us with colors, flowers, and beautiful shapes, forms, and textures while giving us a feeling of relaxation and well-being; trees reduce noise pollution and increase economic stability such as tourism; trees also attract wildlife and diversity which generally cannot be achieved using liquid3 or any other artificial concept.

However, liquid 3 is a good initiative for the climate crisis, which we should overcome immediately. Innovation and critical thinking are paramount to mitigating climate change,‚Äù Mr.Aruna says.

Therefore, it is essential to place trees parallel with liquid 3 wherever possible. Because healthy, well-maintained trees can benefit from improved air and water quality, reducing energy costs and increasing property value. Click here, Archived, for more information.

<h2>The financial cost request of liquid3 vs. real tree</h2>  

Through our analysis, we found that people were concerned about the production and maintenance cost of liquid 3. Here are some tweets. 


We managed to find the approximate production cost of Liquid 3. However, it can be a considerable amount. Liquid 3 bioreactor walls can be made from various plant sources, including waste materials from the forestry and agricultural industries. This makes the casings a highly sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional materials. 

One of the critical advantages of liquid trees is that they can be easily handled. In addition, we can make a liquid tree in any shape because of its flexibility to be molded into any shape or size, making them highly versatile and adaptable for various applications.  

In contrast, the facility requires more maintenance. Every month the amount of water with microalgae has to be changed almost entirely, and the biomass has to be removed. Balken Green News reported that the designer of Liquid 3, Ivan Spasojeviƒá says currently, the monthly maintenance for the handmade prototype costs around EUR 60 per month. Hence, the maintenance cost is relatively high. Click here, Archived, to find out more. 

The cost of planting a tree requires soil, fertilizers, plant, water and labour costs. As well, tree maintenance refers to the regular upkeep of trees, including pruning, watering, fertilizing, and pest control, among other things. Maintaining trees promotes their health and longevity and enhances their aesthetic value. 

The cost of maintaining trees varies depending on several factors, such as the size of the tree, the type of tree, the location, and the level of maintenance required also it‚Äôs vary from region to region. For example, maintaining a large tree may be more expensive than maintaining a smaller tree, and certain types of trees may require more maintenance than others. 

In general, the cost of tree maintenance can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars per year. This cost may include professional tree care services and necessary equipment, supplies, and labour.

<h2>Modern tree placement techniques</h2> 

Root balling is a concept that does not require surrounding soil or deep soil. Instead, the root ball of the tree is shaped and wrapped. Generally, trees with shallow roots require a ‚Äúflatter‚Äù ball, and those with deeply penetrating roots need a deeper ball with a smaller circumference. The preferred diameter of a root ball is about four times the trunk‚Äôs diameter. The generally recommended depth of a root ball is 1.0m. Get more info here, Archived. This technique also can use to place trees in urban areas. However, trees still require more space than liquid3. Nevertheless, the benefit of root ball trees is that they can be fitted into a limited space. 

<h2>How can Liquid3 help mitigate climate change? </h2>

Some potential strategies to mitigate climate change include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which include transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, reducing emissions from transportation, and reducing emissions from industries. 

Furthermore, carbon capture and storage are of paramount importance. This technology involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial processes or the atmosphere and storing it underground or in other long-term storage facilities.

The central part of the liquid3 bioreactors is micro-algae, an excellent sanctifier; it can mainly remove Carbon dioxide and partly remove various pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metal ion. These greenhouse gases directly contribute to climate change since liquid3 helps mitigate climate change by reducing these particles in the air. Microalgae also release oxygen, making fresh and clean air while removing carbon dioxide. 

It also contributes to generating power using renewable energy. The nanofibers used to create liquid trees are highly conductive. They are used to develop high-performance batteries and other energy storage devices. Liquid trees also create highly efficient solar panels and other renewable energy technologies. For more information, click here, Archived.  Renewable energy usually tops the list of changes the world can implement to stave off the worst effects of rising temperatures. Liquid3 bioreactors have given solutions to mitigate climate change to some extent. 

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

Liquid 3 is a bioreactor that consists of water, fluid, and microalgae. Microalgae can absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the atmosphere, also removing greenhouse gases to some extent, helping reduce greenhouse gases in the air. Liquid3 is an entirely new biotechnological air purification solution that mitigates climate change. However, liquid 3 is not a replacement for a real tree. Trees provide many more services on the planet, which technical tools cannot replace. Liquid 3 is a good mitigation tool to combat climate change and purify the air in urban areas. However, prioritizing trees in parallel with liquid3 is more advantageous.

    <h2>Rolltop: A Laptop you can roll</h2>
    When the German company, Orkin Design had conceptualized the Rolltop in 2009, a laptop that will come with a screen so flexible that it can actually be rolled into a sort of scroll, it had caught the attention (and imagination) of the entire world. The tech company said that it will use flexible OLED and touchscreen technologies to create a cylinder-shaped laptop. The lower part of the screen is used as a keyboard while the upper part becomes a 13-inch display. It can also be rolled into a tablet, or expanded to a full 17-inch monitor with a pull-out support at the back attached to the device.



If their dreams are to be realized, the world can say goodbye to the days of laptops filling up the entire bag with numerous cables for different components. The Rolltop will bring all the components of the laptop down to a single screen that will be wrapped around a central cylinder which will act like the processing unit. The top of the cylinder is a detachable power plug. There will be a carry strap that you can use to sling the Rolltop from your shoulders that will double up as a power cord. The cylinder will also contain connectivity ports like USB ports and LAN ports along with speakers. When the Rolltop is not being used, the screen rolls up into an 11-inch tube. A catch-lock will be incorporated into the top of the cylinder to fasten the roll to itself.

After unlocking the catch, the user would roll out the Rolltop display like a mat. A stylus pen has been incorporated into the body of the panel. When rolled up, Rolltop will be 11 inches (28 cm) long and have a 3.26-inch (8.3-cm) diameter Although it works magnificently as a concept, there are still a few technological flaws that are being ironed out.

Orkin has revealed that they weren‚Äôt sure of making Rolltop into a product initially, but the kind of response their concept received made them move ahead with it. The company is now looking for partners/donations to help see this design through to an actual, real-world product.
